Reinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning focused on training agents to make decisions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. The lecture covers core concepts and algorithms in RL.
Key components of RL include states, actions, rewards, transition model, reward model, discount factor, and horizon (number of time steps). The goal is to find an optimal policy that maximizes expected discounted rewards.
RL agents can be categorized as:
Value-based: No explicit policy, uses value function
Policy-based: Explicit policy, no value function
Actor-critic: Combines policy and value function
Model-based: Learns transition and reward models
Model-free: No explicit models (implicit)
RL can be online (interacting with environment) or offline (learning from saved data).
Key concepts include Bellman's Equation and the State-action Bellman Equation, which describe the relationship between value functions and optimal policies.
Q-learning is a model-free RL algorithm that learns the optimal Q-function. It uses an update rule to iteratively improve Q-value estimates based on observed rewards and state transitions.
The Q-learning algorithm steps include:
Initialize Q-values arbitrarily
Repeat:
Select and execute an action
Observe new state and reward
Update Q-value using the update rule
Move to new state
Continue until convergence
Convergence conditions for Q-learning include:
Every state visited infinitely often
Action selection becomes greedy over time
Learning rate decreases appropriately
Exploration strategies are crucial for balancing exploration and exploitation:
Epsilon-greedy: Random action with probability epsilon, best action otherwise
Boltzmann exploration: Probabilistic action selection based on Q-values and temperature parameter
The lecture also includes an example of the inverted pendulum problem and a Q-learning exercise to demonstrate the update process.
Effective exploration is essential for learning optimal policies in RL. The choice of exploration strategy can significantly impact the learning process and the quality of the learned policy.
